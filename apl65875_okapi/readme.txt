APL65875 - Arthur LeBlanc, 6210 Simulation and Modeling class
There are two provided agents. The important one is apl65875_okapi. That is an improved version of SimpleAgent.py. It removes the random fluctuation between max and min, and always bets everything it can on the stock if betting is possible. In the original SimpleAgent, there may be a time when stock could be bought, but there was not enough cash to implement the order of max*number of shares. This agent overcomes that. It might be possible to optimize further with checking if more useful orders were possible, but the time scale is probably small enough to not make much of a difference.

apl65875_tapir just implements bollinger bands. It turns out they are awful for trading in a single day. It could make a slight bit of money if optimized to a certain band width, but it just doesn't compare to Simple_Agent.
