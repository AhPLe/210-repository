Since files may be overwritten, this contains all the assignments after HW1 through 9-25-2020. From Mattern, P1, or other. I included them into the HW2 folder. All that's really necessary is the Mattern for this specific homework 2. I don't think it was ever really indicated how this was supposed to be submitted, I probably should have asked. Something like this containing HW1 and HW2 material both will likely be submitted via ELC
